# INVEST in Kandahar

INVEST seeks to address the longer-term needs identified by IDPs by providing vocational training linked to economic opportunities within the locale, and by delivering life skills modules to further support graduates and aid repatriation to home provinces. The program will deliver market-specific vocational and life skills training to 7,500 vulnerable individuals in Kandahar, Afghanistan by 2017.

In 2011, UNHCR and the World Bank completed research on IDPs in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat cities interviewing 450 IDP households. UNHCR found that conflict-induced displacement, limited reintegration opportunities for returning refugees, the rapid growth of cities, and the proliferation of informal settlements constitute an enormously complex challenge for the government, municipalities, and humanitarian and development actors in Afghanistan. The study highlighted that displacement to urban centers is rarely temporary, at least partly due to livelihood opportunities; and that  IDPs have fewer labor market opportunities than host community members. This is mainly due to the lack of skills adapted to the economic context and lower literacy rate, which translates into lower earning capacity and higher vulnerability to poverty.

International and national groups deliver humanitarian assistance, yet there is an acute demand for funding to shift towards economic recovery and direct livelihood opportunities for the returnee and IDP population. Afghan and international actors must go beyond a purely humanitarian approach and look for sustainable solutions for IDPs. Market-driven, short-term technical and life skills training linked to job placements â€“ that support existing Afghan government interventions - can address this demand.

Since trainings began in the first year of INVEST-in-Kandahar, we have received numerous requests from various communities and government departments to offer technical vocational and educational (TVET) courses in their localities, further emphasising the desire for more sustainable support. UNOCHA also highlighted the benefit of vocational training or educational support to displaced persons as a means of supporting sustainable reintegration and mitigating various protection risks. Building on the successful DFID-funded INVEST model in Helmand, the program conducted a detailed market assessment in Kandahar to identify key in-demand skills in the current marketplace, which has guided the selection of courses offered.
