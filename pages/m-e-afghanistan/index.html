<p>Monitoring and Evaluation practices are fundamental to the success of a program.  The Afghanistan M&amp;E team has implemented a new digitized workflow that allows them to quickly collect, analyze, securely store and report on programs in real time.</p>

<p>To ensure program teams are well equipped and trained to use data-driven M&amp;E tools and systems, to inform and improve programming through evidence-based learning.</p>

<h1 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h1>

<p>The Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Unit at Mercy Corps Afghanistan embraces an M&amp;E approach that utilizes the power of computing and technology to improve our program monitoring efforts. Harnessing mobile technology has become a cost-effective solution that leaves behind traditional paper and pencil data collection methods. We find that by conducting surveys using tablets, we are able to reduce data collection times, automate data validation and improve beneficiary verification through the collection of geo-location data, photographs and other biometric data. The integration of mobile data collection and cloud-based sharing platforms into our workflow allows us to access data in near real-time—enabling us to provide donors and Mercy Corps headquarters with remote monitoring applications that feature interactive dashboards and maps where administrators can receive progress updates on programs. Our approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embraces technology where possible. We strive to utilize free and open-source software so that our tools can be built upon, shared and adopted by others in the global development community.</li>
  <li>Follows an iterative process of conceptualizing, testing, reviewing, and learning in order to improve our system and tools.</li>
  <li>Emphasizes adaptive management—allowing iterative programming that uses near real-time monitoring to learn and adjust in order to make informed decisions. We have developed a system flexible enough to meet the ever-changing demands of our programs.</li>
  <li>Helps provide support and develop team member capacity in identified skill sets that align with our strategic objectives. Our team members contribute and receive support from their expert working groups, which foster an eco-system that improves our ability to better manage, collaborate and innovate. This has led us to utilize staff at a higher capacity toward greater M&amp;E responsibilities in analytical rigor and reporting.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="our-mel-team">Our MEL Team</h1>

<p>The role of the Kabul-based MEL team is to provide direct support to all field teams in the collection and management of program data including guidance in data analysis, data visualization and report writing in order to identify trends and highlight lessons learned from program activities. To bring consistency across our programs, our MEL team has developed a flexible, open-source country-level M&amp;E system that all Program teams are able to use. In addition, the MEL team conducts field visits to monitor project activities and ensures field teams are trained in the
latest M&amp;E tools.</p>

<p>Our Kabul-based MEL team provides support to all program and support teams through 6 expert working groups:</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-reporting">Analysis And Reporting</h2>
<p>The role of the Analysis and Reporting team is to provide analytical and graphic support to program teams on reporting accurate findings and documenting lessons learned. Working closely with the Survey Design group, this team develops analysis plans that allow us to test theories of change and learn from our results.</p>

<h2 id="program-management-at-mercy-corps-pmmc">Program Management At Mercy Corps (PM@MC)</h2>

<p>The PM@MC team is responsible for program information and quality assurance for all programs across the country portfolio.  The team is split into two parts: 1) Project Cycle Management, who oversees the development and review of the standard 11 Forms and backup documents; 2) PM@MC requirements and the Project Database, who ensures all programs are in compliance with our agency-wide program management initiative, PM@MC and administers updates to the Project Database, a output-level indicator tracker. These functions will allow program teams to receive accurate and updated information regarding their program performance in near real-time through a summary dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="program-performance">Program Performance</h2>

<p>The team supports program teams in the development of the logical framework, indicator plan, and M&amp;E matrix and conducts a review of all Project Agreements before project activities are implemented. These key tools help to conceptualize program objectives and measure achievements toward our targets. Since these tools can change throughout the program lifecycle, our team will support program teams in revising and updating their tools to ensure that what we are measuring is aligned with current program objectives.</p>

<h2 id="program-technology">Program Technology</h2>

<p>Whether there is a new tool or software that needs to be tested or a gap is identified in our programmatic efforts, our Program Technology team works to find a solution. Housed within the MEL unit, the Program Technology team supports the testing, review of and training in new tools that can be replicated and scaled across our programs or support departments. Learning through an iterative process has allowed this team to develop tools knowing that they could be easily discarded for a new tool. Through this process of creative destruction, we learn how to continually adjust, innovate and solve problems. Some recent initiatives taken by the team include the complete rollout of mobile data collection tools across all our programs and the setup and staff training in Wrike, a new cloud-based project management tool that all program teams and departments use to improve task management and coordination.</p>

<h2 id="survey-design">Survey Design</h2>

<p>The Survey Design team ensures program evaluations adhere to the best practices in survey design, both quantitative and qualitative tools and sampling methods that are instrumental to achieving robust results. The team will utilize our flexible mobile data collection tools giving us real-time access to data so we can monitor and verify the progress of survey campaigns and provide our Analysis and Reporting team with a live dataset where they can perform preliminary analyses even before collection is completed.</p>

<h2 id="program-and-data-management-system-toladata">Program and Data Management System (TolaData)</h2>

<p>The goal of Tola is to support adaptive program management and enable experience based learning by providing tools that can improve the quality of program M&amp;E data. Tola is a complete data management system which utilizes the power of cloud-based technologies to improve program monitoring efforts without losing the ability to work offline in remote areas. Once data has been collected, Tola blends data collection tools with workflow tools and a centralized collection database to allow for cumulative and summary reporting. By using existing open source solutions and standards the Tola team can develop custom implementations, that can integrate with third party software without incurring high maintenance costs.</p>
